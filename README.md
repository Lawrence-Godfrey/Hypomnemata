This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault contains notes on AI-related topics such as machine learning, natural language processing, and neural networks. To use this vault in Obsidian:
 - Clone this repo locally.
 - In Obsidian, click **File** > **Open Vault**.
 - Click the button next to **Open folder as vault**. 
 - Select the local repo.

There are flashcards for all notes, which are stored in [flashcards](AI/Machine Learning & Data Science/flashcards), and can be used with the [Spaced Repetition](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-spaced-repetition) plugin. Flashcards are generated using my [flashcard-generator](https://github.com/Lawrence-Godfrey/flashcard-generator). Remember to add this folder to Obsidian's exclusion list so it doesn't appear in searches, etc.
