## Matrix Multiplication Properties

### Commutative Property
$$A \times B \neq B \times A$$
### Associative Property
$$(A \times B ) \times C = A \times (B \times C)$$
### Identity Matrix Properties
The identity matrix, denoted $I$ or $I_{n\times n}$ is a square matrix with ones along the diagonal and zeros everywhere else.

For any matrix A
$$A \cdot I = I \cdot A = A$$
### Inverse
$$A(A^{-1}) = (A^{-1})A = I$$
Note: Not all matrices have an inverse. These are known as "singular" or "degenerate".
