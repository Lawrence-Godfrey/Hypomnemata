Bayes' rule (or Bayes' theorem) is a fundamental concept in the theory of probability and provides a way to find the probability of an event based on the probability of a related event. It's an extension of [[conditional probability]] and is particularly useful when dealing with prior and updated knowledge.

The theorem is stated as:
$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)\times P(A)}{P(B)}
$$
