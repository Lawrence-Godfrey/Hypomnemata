What is an autoencoder and its main application in time-series data?
?
An autoencoder is a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, particularly for compressing input data into a lower-dimensional representation and reconstructing it. In time-series data, it can be used to detect anomalies or extract features.

How does Principal Component Analysis (PCA) work with time-series data?
?
PCA traditionally reduces dimensionality in static data, but can be applied to time-series data by transforming it into a matrix where each row corresponds to a time series, helping to identify significant patterns.

What is Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and what is its application in time-series data?
?
ICA separates a multivariate signal into additive, independent components. In time-series data, it can be used for tasks like source separation and noise reduction.

What is Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and how is it applied in clustering time-series data?
?
DTW measures similarity between two time-series sequences that may vary in speed and can be used as a distance metric in clustering algorithms like k-means to cluster time-series data.

How are Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) used with time-series data?
?
GMMs model the underlying distribution of time-series data and can be combined with the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm for clustering and anomaly detection.

What is the purpose of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in relation to time-series data?
?
HMMs describe the evolution of observable events dependent on unobservable internal factors and are useful for sequential data tasks such as pattern recognition and anomaly detection.

What are Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) and how do they assist with time-series data?
?
SOMs are neural networks trained through unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional representation of input space, useful for clustering and visualising high-dimensional time-series data.

Explain t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) and its application for time-series data.
?
t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction technique designed for visualising high-dimensional datasets, effectively transforming the data into a two or three-dimensional space to visualise clusters in time-series data.
