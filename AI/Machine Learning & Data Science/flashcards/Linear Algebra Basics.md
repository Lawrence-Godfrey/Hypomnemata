What is the commutative property of matrix multiplication?
?
A × B ≠ B × A.

What does the associative property of matrix multiplication state?
?
(A × B) × C = A × (B × C).

What is an identity matrix?
?
The identity matrix, denoted I or I_{n×n}, is a square matrix with ones along the diagonal and zeros everywhere else.

What are the properties of the identity matrix?
?
For any matrix A, A · I = I · A = A.

What is the definition of an inverse matrix?
?
A(A^{-1}) = (A^{-1})A = I. Not all matrices have an inverse; those that don't are called 'singular' or 'degenerate'.

What are the two main properties that define a linear function?
?
1. Additivity (Superposition): f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y). 2. Homogeneity (Scalar Multiplication): f(cx) = c f(x) for any constant c.

What does additivity (superposition) of a function mean?
?
It means that the function’s output for the sum of two inputs is the same as the sum of the outputs for each input individually.

What does the homogeneity property of a function indicate?
?
It indicates that scaling the input by a constant c scales the output by the same constant.

Why is it important for a function to respect vector addition and scalar multiplication?
?
It ensures that the function preserves the way inputs combine and the relative magnitudes of the inputs.

Can all matrices be inverted?
?
No, not all matrices have an inverse; those that do not are termed 'singular' or 'degenerate'.
