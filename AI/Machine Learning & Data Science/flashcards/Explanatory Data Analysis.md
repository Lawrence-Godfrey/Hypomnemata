What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and why is it important?
?
EDA is a critical step before model building that helps understand the structure, trends, and anomalies in the data.

What are some common descriptive statistics used in EDA?
?
Mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.

How can you analyze categorical variables during EDA?
?
By looking at the frequency distribution of each category.

What is the purpose of data cleaning in EDA?
?
To check for missing values and outliers, deciding how to handle them effectively.

What techniques can be used for univariate analysis?
?
Histograms or kernel density plots for numerical variables, and bar charts for categorical variables.

What type of plot can be used in bivariate analysis to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables?
?
Scatter plots.

How can box plots be useful in EDA?
?
They show how numerical variables are distributed with respect to categorical variables.

What does a correlation matrix depict in EDA?
?
It shows the quantitative relationships between numerical variables.

What are pair plots used for in multivariate analysis?
?
To visualize bivariate relationships across multiple numerical variables.

What is feature engineering in the context of EDA?
?
Creating new variables that may better represent the problem to solve.

When should you handle missing values in EDA?
?
During the data cleaning process.

Why is it important to check for outliers in the data?
?
Outliers can skew the results and interpretations of your analysis.

What is a heatmap used for in multivariate analysis?
?
To visualize correlations across multiple variables.

Why might you create new variables during feature engineering?
?
To improve model accuracy by better representing the underlying patterns of the data.

What statistical analysis can highlight trends in data distributions during EDA?
?
Descriptive statistics and visualization techniques like histograms.
