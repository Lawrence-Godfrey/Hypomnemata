What does AUC-ROC stand for?
?
Area Under ROC Curve.

What does the ROC curve represent in a classification model?
?
The ROC curve represents the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate at different classification thresholds.

Why is AUC-ROC useful for models with confidence scores?
?
AUC-ROC is useful because it provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds, allowing us to assess the model's ability to distinguish between classes more effectively.

What does a higher AUC-ROC value indicate about a model's performance?
?
A higher AUC-ROC value indicates better model performance in distinguishing between classes.

What range of values can AUC-ROC take?
?
AUC-ROC values range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0.5 indicates no discriminative ability and a value of 1 indicates perfect discrimination.

In the context of AUC-ROC, what is the significance of a value of 0.5?
?
An AUC-ROC value of 0.5 indicates that the model has no ability to distinguish between the positive and negative classes, similar to random guessing.

How can AUC-ROC be used when comparing multiple models?
?
AUC-ROC can be used as a metric to compare the performance of different classification models; a model with a higher AUC-ROC value is generally preferred.
