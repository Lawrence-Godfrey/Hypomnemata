What are the primary components of a cell?
?
Nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus.

What is the function of the mitochondria?
?
Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell and are responsible for producing energy (ATP) through cellular respiration.

What role does the nucleus play in a cell?
?
The nucleus stores genetic material (DNA) and coordinates cell activities such as growth, metabolism, protein synthesis, and cell division.

How do ribosomes contribute to protein synthesis?
?
Ribosomes translate messenger RNA (mRNA) into polypeptide chains, which then fold into functional proteins.

Define cellular respiration. Why is it important?
?
Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy (ATP), carbon dioxide, and water. It is crucial for survival as it provides the energy needed for cellular functions.

What are the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
?
Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, are generally smaller, and are unicellular (e.g., bacteria). Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, are larger, and can be unicellular or multicellular (e.g., plants, animals).

What is the function of the Golgi apparatus?
?
The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for secretion or delivery to other organelles.

What is the significance of the cell membrane?
?
The cell membrane protects the cell, provides structure, and regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell.

What processes results in the movement across the cell membrane?
?
Diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion, active transport, and endocytosis/exocytosis.
