What is feature extraction in natural language processing?
?
Feature extraction is the process of transforming raw text data into a format that can be understood and analyzed by machine learning algorithms.

How are vocabulary vectors used in feature extraction?
?
Vocabulary vectors represent words or phrases as vectors of size equal to the vocabulary, with each element set to 1 for corresponding words in the phrase.

What is a significant problem associated with using sparse representations in NLP?
?
As the vocabulary size increases, the vector becomes more sparse (more zeros), which can affect the efficiency and performance of NLP tasks.

What is the purpose of generating frequency vectors in feature extraction?
?
Frequency vectors are generated to count the occurrences of words in different classes, allowing a classification based on word frequencies in a given class.

How is a feature vector X generated from word frequencies?
?
A feature vector X is generated by summing the frequencies of each word in different classes, resulting in a vector structured as X_{m}= [1, sum(frequencies for class 0), sum(frequencies for class 1), ..., sum(frequencies for class k)].

What does freqs(w, k) represent in the context of feature extraction?
?
freqs(w, k) represents the frequency of the word w in class k.

Describe one disadvantage of using a large vocabulary size for feature extraction. 
?
A large vocabulary size results in sparse vectors, which can negatively impact the performance and efficiency of machine learning models in NLP.

What is the significance of the first element in the feature vector X_{m}?
?
The first element is typically a bias term or a constant to account for the presence of the phrase.
