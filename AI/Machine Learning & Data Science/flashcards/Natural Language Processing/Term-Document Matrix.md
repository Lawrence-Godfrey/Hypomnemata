What do the rows in a Term-Document Matrix represent?
?
The rows represent terms (words or phrases).

What do the columns in a Document-Term Matrix represent?
?
The columns represent documents.

What does each entry in a Term-Document Matrix indicate?
?
Each entry indicates the frequency (or sometimes weighted frequency) of a term in a particular document.

In the given example, what is the frequency of the term 'sweet' in Doc3?
?
The frequency of the term 'sweet' in Doc3 is 1.

How is the term frequency represented in the provided Term-Document Matrix example?
?
The term frequency is represented by the number in the corresponding cell where a term and a document intersect.

What is the purpose of using TF-IDF in Term-Document Matrices?
?
TF-IDF weighs terms by their importance, giving higher weights to terms that are frequent in a specific document but not across many documents in the corpus.

What does TF-IDF stand for?
?
TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.

In the example matrix, what is the term frequency of 'apples' in Document 1?
?
The term frequency of 'apples' in Document 1 is 1.

How does too high frequency of a term across multiple documents affect its TF-IDF weight?
?
A term that is too frequent across many documents will have a lower TF-IDF weight because it is less likely to be informative.

What implication does a zero entry in the Term-Document Matrix have regarding term occurrence?
?
A zero entry indicates that the term does not occur in that particular document.
