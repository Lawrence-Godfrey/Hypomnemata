What is a co-occurrence matrix?
?
A co-occurrence matrix captures the frequencies with which pairs of words appear together in a certain context.

What can 'context' refer to in a co-occurrence matrix?
?
Context can be defined as a fixed window of n words, within the same sentence, or some other scope.

Provide an example of a scenario where a co-occurrence matrix could be useful.
?
It is useful for semantic analysis and building word embeddings.

How can a co-occurrence matrix assist in semantic analysis?
?
Words that frequently appear together are likely related in meaning.

What is GloVe and how does it relate to co-occurrence matrices?
?
GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) leverages co-occurrence statistics to generate word embeddings.

In the example provided, what is the window size used to create the co-occurrence matrix?
?
The window size used is 1 word.

What does each entry (i, j) in the co-occurrence matrix represent?
?
Each entry (i, j) indicates how often word i appears next to word j in the corpus.

List two applications of co-occurrence matrices.
?
1. Semantic Analysis 2. Building word embeddings (e.g., GloVe).
