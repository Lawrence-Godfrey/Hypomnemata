What is the primary function of the mitochondria in cells?
?
The primary function of the mitochondria is to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energy currency of the cell, through a process called cellular respiration.

Describe the process of photosynthesis. What are its main stages?
?
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose. The main stages are the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions).

What role do ribosomes play in a cell?
?
Ribosomes are the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis, translating messenger RNA (mRNA) into polypeptide chains (proteins).

How is the structure of DNA related to its function in heredity?
?
DNA has a double helix structure, with complementary base pairing that allows it to store genetic information. This structure allows for accurate replication and transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next.

What is the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
?
Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells have a defined nucleus and various membrane-bound organelles.

Explain the significance of the cell membrane in cellular function.
?
The cell membrane regulates what enters and exits the cell, maintaining homeostasis, and provides protection and support. It also plays a role in communication and signaling between cells.

What is the function of enzymes in biological reactions?
?
Enzymes are catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in biological systems by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur.

What is the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis?
?
Chlorophyll is the green pigment in plants that captures light energy, which is used to drive the photosynthetic process.

Define osmosis and explain its importance in cells.
?
Osmosis is the movement of water molecules through a semipermeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. It is crucial for maintaining cell turgor and overall fluid balance.

How do mutations affect DNA and protein synthesis?
?
Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that can affect protein synthesis by altering the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein, potentially impacting its structure and function.
