How do Frequentists define probability?
?
Frequentists define probability as the long-run frequency of events, viewing it as an objective property of the physical world.

What is the significance of a 95% confidence interval in Frequentist statistics?
?
A 95% confidence interval means that if the experiment were repeated many times, 95% of the constructed intervals would contain the true parameter.

What does a p-value indicate in Frequentist hypothesis testing?
?
A p-value indicates the probability of obtaining a result as extreme or more extreme than the observed result, given that the null hypothesis is true.

What is the primary emphasis of the Bayesian interpretation of probability?
?
Bayesians interpret probability as a measure of belief or certainty about an event, which can vary from person to person.

In Bayesian statistics, how are parameters treated?
?
Parameters are treated as Random Variables with their own prior distributions, which are updated with data to form a posterior distribution.

What is Bayes' Rule and its role in Bayesian hypothesis testing?
?
Bayes' Rule is used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on observed data, allowing for the comparison of hypotheses through their posterior probabilities.

Why might the Bayesian approach be preferred in the presence of limited data?
?
The Bayesian approach can be advantageous with limited data because it allows for the incorporation of prior distributions to inform estimates.

What is a credible interval in Bayesian statistics?
?
A credible interval gives a range of values within which the parameter lies with a certain probability, analogous to a confidence interval in Frequentist statistics.

What challenges does the Bayesian approach face with prior distributions?
?
If the chosen prior distribution is incorrect, it can lead to inaccurate results, impacting the reliability of posterior probabilities.

What is the difference in data requirements between Frequentist and Bayesian approaches?
?
Frequentist approaches are typically preferred with large data sets and no prior understanding of data distribution, while Bayesian approaches are useful with limited data when a prior is available.
