What does probability measure?
?
Probability measures the percentage chance that a specific event will occur based on a set of conditions.

What does likelihood measure?
?
Likelihood measures the degree to which given data supports a particular statistical model or hypothesis.

When is probability used?
?
Probability is used when you have the model and want to predict outcomes.

When is likelihood used?
?
Likelihood is used when you have the outcomes and want to understand the model that best fits those results.

Can you define the primary difference between likelihood and probability?
?
The primary difference is that probability predicts outcomes based on a model, while likelihood evaluates how well a model explains observed outcomes.

Give an example of a situation where you would use probability.
?
A situation where you would use probability could be predicting the weather based on meteorological models.

Give an example of a situation where you would use likelihood.
?
A situation where you would use likelihood could be determining which statistical model best fits a set of experimental data.

How does understanding the difference between likelihood and probability benefit data analysis?
?
Understanding the difference helps in correctly interpreting results and making appropriate conclusions based on data and models.
