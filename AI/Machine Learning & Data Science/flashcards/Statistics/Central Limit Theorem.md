What does the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) state?
?
The CLT states that when an adequately large number of independent, identically distributed random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original distribution.

What is the rule of thumb regarding sample size for the CLT to hold?
?
The rule of thumb states that the sample size must be at least 30 for the Central Limit Theorem to work properly.

Provide an example of how the CLT can be demonstrated using sampling.
?
Sample 20 points from a uniform distribution, calculate the mean, and plot the means on a histogram multiple times. The histogram of means will approach the shape of a normal distribution.

How does the sample mean $ar{X}$ behave as sample size $n$ increases according to the CLT?
?
As the sample size $n$ becomes large, the distribution of the sample mean $ar{X}$ will approach a normal distribution with mean $
u$ and standard deviation $rac{	au}{oot{n}}$.

What are some practical applications of the Central Limit Theorem?
?
The CLT allows for the use of tools like Confidence Intervals, T-tests, and ANOVA, even when the original data does not follow a normal distribution.

If a population has a mean $
u = 100$ and standard deviation $	au = 15$, what will be the standard deviation of the sample mean for a sample size of 50?
?
The standard deviation of the sample mean will be $rac{15}{oot{50}}$.

Why is the Central Limit Theorem important in statistics?
?
The CLT is important because it allows statisticians to make inferences about the population mean using the sample mean, knowing that it will be close to the true mean in large samples.

What happens to the distribution of sample means if the original data is skewed or not normally distributed?
?
According to the CLT, the distribution of sample means will still approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the original data's distribution.
