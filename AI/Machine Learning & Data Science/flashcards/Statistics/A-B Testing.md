What is A/B testing?
?
A/B testing is a method used to compare two versions of a variable to determine which one performs better, commonly used in marketing, product development, and web design.

What is the first step in the A/B testing procedure?
?
Hypothesis Formulation: Define what you want to test, for example, a new button color.

How do you split the audience in A/B testing?
?
Randomly divide the audience into two groups: Group A (control) and Group B (variant).

What do you need to ensure while collecting data in an A/B test?
?
The sample size must be large enough to detect a meaningful difference, and metrics used should be directly impacted by the changes being tested.

Why is random sampling important in A/B testing?
?
It ensures that each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to either group, making the groups comparable.

What does independence mean in the context of A/B testing?
?
Observations are independent; one user's behaviour does not influence another user's behaviour.

What should remain identical during an A/B test?
?
All conditions except for the tested element should remain the same for both groups.

What is the implication of 'No Peeking' in A/B testing?
?
Avoid looking at test results before completion to prevent incorrect conclusions caused by statistical noise.

What is meant by metric sensitivity in A/B testing?
?
The chosen metrics should be sensitive enough to detect changes caused by the variant.

Why is it important to have a homogeneous population in A/B testing?
?
To ensure that the test groups are comparable and that demographic differences are evenly distributed.

What can confound results during an A/B test?
?
Major changes in the external environment, such as holidays or news events, can influence user behaviour.

What is the purpose of power analysis in A/B testing?
?
To determine the required sample size necessary to detect a meaningful difference between the control and variant groups.

What is a common example of variables tested in A/B testing?
?
Comparing two different webpage layouts to see which one results in higher conversion rates.

What happens in the analysis phase of A/B testing?
?
Statistical methods are used to determine if there is a significant difference between the two groups.

What is the final step after analyzing the data in A/B testing?
?
Draw a conclusion on whether to implement the changes based on the test results.
