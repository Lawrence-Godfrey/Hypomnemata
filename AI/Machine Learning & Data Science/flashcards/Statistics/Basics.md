What is the difference between a population and a sample in statistics?
?
A population refers to the entire group of individuals or objects studied, while a sample is a subset of the population selected for study.

What is the principle of random sampling in statistical analysis?
?
Random sampling is a basic principle that ensures each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample.

What does 'i.i.d' stand for in the context of sampling?
?
i.i.d stands for 'independently and identically distributed', meaning samples are both independent from one another and drawn from the same probability distribution.

In machine learning, how does a dataset relate to a population?
?
A dataset in machine learning is essentially a sample of a population, intended to be a representative subset.

What is the formula for calculating sample variance?
?
The formula for sample variance is: $s^{2} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2$ where $x_i$ are the observations, $ar{x}$ is the sample mean, and $n$ is the number of observations.

What does the Law of Large Numbers state?
?
The Law of Large Numbers states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample is likely to approach the average of the population.

Why is it important for samples to be independent in analysis?
?
Independence ensures that the selection or outcome of one sample does not affect another, which is crucial for unbiased statistical inference.

What are the implications of a non-representative sample in machine learning?
?
A non-representative sample can lead to biased models, poor generalization to new data, and erroneous conclusions.

What is the significance of using the sample mean $ar{x}$ to estimate the population mean $	ext{μ}$?
?
The sample mean $ar{x}$ provides an unbiased estimate of the population mean μ, especially as the sample size increases.

What should be ensured about the distribution when taking multiple samples?
?
Each sample should be identically distributed, meaning they should come from the same underlying probability distribution.
