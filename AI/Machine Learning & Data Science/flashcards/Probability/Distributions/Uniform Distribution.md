What is a Uniform Distribution?
?
A Uniform Distribution, also known as a rectangular distribution, is a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely.

What is the probability density function of a uniform distribution?
?
The probability density function of a uniform distribution is given by: f_{X}(x) = 1/(b-a) for a ≤ x ≤ b, and f_{X}(x) = 0 otherwise.

What does the notation f_{X}(x) represent in the context of a uniform distribution?
?
f_{X}(x) represents the probability density function for a random variable X in a uniform distribution.

In the probability density function of a uniform distribution, what do 'a' and 'b' represent?
?
'a' and 'b' represent the lower and upper limits of the distribution, respectively.

What are the characteristics of a uniform distribution?
?
In a uniform distribution, all outcomes within the interval [a, b] have the same probability of occurring, making it a constant probability density across that range.

Can you explain what '0' in f_{X}(x) = 0 means?
?
It means that the probability density function is zero for any value of x that is not within the interval [a, b], indicating those outcomes are impossible.

How would you describe the shape of a uniform distribution graph?
?
The graph of a uniform distribution is rectangular in shape, indicating that every value within the range has an equal probability.

What type of experiments or situations can be modeled using a uniform distribution?
?
Uniform distributions can model scenarios where outcomes are equally likely, such as rolling a fair die or selecting a random number from a defined interval.

How do you calculate the mean of a uniform distribution?
?
The mean of a uniform distribution can be calculated using the formula: mean = (a + b) / 2.

What is the variance of a uniform distribution?
?
The variance of a uniform distribution is given by the formula: variance = (b - a)^2 / 12.
