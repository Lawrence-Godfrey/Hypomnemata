What does a Bernoulli Distribution represent?
?
A Bernoulli Distribution represents a discrete probability distribution for a random variable that can take only two possible outcomes: success (1) or failure (0).

What are the two possible outcomes in a Bernoulli Distribution?
?
The two possible outcomes in a Bernoulli Distribution are often labeled as success (1) and failure (0).

Is the Bernoulli Distribution continuous or discrete?
?
The Bernoulli Distribution is a discrete probability distribution.

What type of random variables are modeled by a Bernoulli Distribution?
?
A Bernoulli Distribution models random variables that can take only two values, typically representing two outcomes like success and failure.

Can you provide an example of a scenario modeled by a Bernoulli Distribution?
?
Flipping a coin, where getting heads can be considered success (1) and tails as failure (0).

In the context of a Bernoulli Distribution, what does 'success' represent?
?
In the context of a Bernoulli Distribution, 'success' typically represents the outcome labeled as 1.

In a Bernoulli Distribution, what does 'failure' correspond to?
?
In a Bernoulli Distribution, 'failure' corresponds to the outcome labeled as 0.
