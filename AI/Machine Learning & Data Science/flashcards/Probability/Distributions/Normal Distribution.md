What is the Normal Distribution commonly known as?
?
Gaussian Distribution.

Describe the shape of the Normal Distribution curve.
?
It has a bell-shaped curve.

What percentage of values fall within one standard deviation of the mean in a Normal Distribution?
?
Approximately 68%.

What are the three key statistics that are all equal in a Normal Distribution?
?
Mean, median, and mode.

What is the notation used to represent a Normal Distribution?
?
N(μ, σ²) where μ is the mean and σ² is the variance.

Write the formula for the Probability Density Function (PDF) of a Normal Distribution.
?
f(x) = (1/(σ√(2π))) e^(-(x-μ)² / 2σ²) 

What makes the Standard Normal Distribution different from the general Normal Distribution?
?
In the Standard Normal Distribution, the mean μ is zero and the standard deviation σ is one.

What is the PDF formula for the Standard Normal Distribution?
?
f(z) = (1/√(2π)) e^(-z² / 2) 

How do you standardize a Normal Distribution?
?
By subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

What is the Z-score in statistics?
?
The Z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.

If X and Y are independent Gaussian distributions, what is the distribution of their sum W = X + Y?
?
W follows a Normal Distribution N(aμₓ + bμᵧ, a²σ²ₓ + b²σ²ᵧ).

What are the parameters of a Gaussian distribution represented by?
?
μ is the mean, and σ² is the variance.

What does the area under the Normal Distribution curve represent?
?
The total probability, which equals 1.

Why is the Normal Distribution considered important in statistics?
?
Due to its properties and natural occurrence in various phenomena.

Define the term 'Variance' in the context of Normal Distribution.
?
Variance (σ²) measures the dispersion of the data points around the mean.
