What is a t-distribution?
?
A t-distribution is a type of probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped, similar to the Normal Distribution but with heavier tails.

When is a t-distribution commonly used?
?
It is often used in confidence intervals when there is uncertainty about the standard deviation in a normally distributed population, especially in small sample sizes.

What does 'degree of freedom' refer to in the context of a t-distribution?
?
It refers to the number of independent observations in a data set.

How does the shape of the t-distribution change with an increase in degrees of freedom?
?
As the degrees of freedom increases, the t-distribution approaches a Normal Distribution, with the tails getting smaller.

Why do heavier tails in a t-distribution indicate greater uncertainty?
?
Heavier tails suggest a higher probability of extreme values, indicating greater uncertainty in measurements or estimates.

What happens to the t-distribution as the sample size increases?
?
As the sample size increases, the distribution approaches a Normal Distribution, reflecting increased confidence in the measurement.

How can one visualize the difference between t-distribution and Normal Distribution?
?
By plotting both distributions, one can observe that the t-distribution has heavier tails (more spread out) compared to the Normal Distribution.
