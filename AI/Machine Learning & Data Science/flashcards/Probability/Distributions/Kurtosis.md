What is kurtosis in statistics?
?
Kurtosis is a statistical measure that defines how heavily the tails of a distribution differ from the tails of a normal distribution.

What is the formula for calculating kurtosis?
?
Kurtosis = E[(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma})^{4}] = \frac{E[(X - \mu)^{4}]}{\sigma^{4}}.

In the kurtosis formula, what does E[(X - μ)^4] represent?
?
E[(X - μ)^4] represents the fourth moment about the mean.

What do the symbols μ and σ represent in the kurtosis formula?
?
μ represents the mean of the dataset, and σ represents the standard deviation.

How does kurtosis help in understanding the distribution of data?
?
Kurtosis helps in understanding the extremity of outliers in the data; high kurtosis indicates heavy tails and more outliers, while low kurtosis indicates light tails.

What does a kurtosis value greater than 3 signify?
?
A kurtosis value greater than 3 signifies that the distribution has heavier tails than a normal distribution, indicating a potential for more extreme outliers.

What are the implications of negative kurtosis?
?
Negative kurtosis indicates light tails and a flatter distribution than normal, suggesting a lower likelihood of extreme outliers.

If a dataset has a kurtosis of exactly 3, what does that imply?
?
A kurtosis of exactly 3 implies that the distribution is mesokurtic, which is identical to the kurtosis of a normal distribution.
