What is a Binomial Distribution?
?
A Binomial Distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (experiments with two possible outcomes: success or failure).

What does the binomial coefficient represent?
?
The binomial coefficient represents the number of ways in which a certain event can occur.

Write the formula for the binomial coefficient.
?
$$ {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$ where $n$ is the total number of trials and $k$ is the number of successful trials.

How is the binomial coefficient used in a coin toss experiment?
?
In a coin toss experiment, $n \choose k$ represents the number of combinations of landing $k$ heads in $n$ coin tosses.

What is the PMF (Probability Mass Function) of a Binomial Distribution?
?
The PMF of a Binomial Distribution gives the probability of obtaining exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials and is given by: $$P(X=k) = {n \choose k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$$ where $p$ is the probability of success.

Explain why the binomial coefficient accounts for combinations rather than permutations.
?
The binomial coefficient accounts for combinations because it divides by the factorial of the number of successful and unsuccessful trials, which eliminates the over-counting of arrangements (e.g., different orders of the same events that are not distinct).
