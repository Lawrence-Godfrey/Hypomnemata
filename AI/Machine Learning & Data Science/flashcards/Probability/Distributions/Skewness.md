What does skewness measure in a probability distribution?
?
Skewness measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean.

Why is skewness important in statistics?
?
Skewness is useful for determining how distorted or skewed a distribution is from the normal distribution.

How does a positive skewness affect the shape of a distribution?
?
A positive skewness indicates that the distribution has a longer tail on the right side.

What does a negative skewness imply about a distribution?
?
A negative skewness indicates that the distribution has a longer tail on the left side.

In terms of skewness, how would a perfectly normal distribution be characterized?
?
A perfectly normal distribution has a skewness of 0, indicating symmetry.

Can skewness be negative, positive, or zero?
?
Yes, skewness can be negative, positive, or zero, indicating left, right, or symmetrical distributions respectively.

What impact can skewness have on data analysis and interpretation?
?
Skewness can affect the validity of statistical tests, assumptions about the data, and the interpretation of the mean and median.

What statistical measures can be used to assess skewness in data?
?
Statistical measures such as Pearson's skewness coefficient or the third standardized moment can be used to assess skewness.
