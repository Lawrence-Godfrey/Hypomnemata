What is the primary function of the mitochondria in a cell?
?
The primary function of the mitochondria is to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which serves as the energy currency of the cell.

What is cellular respiration and why is it important?
?
Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy, carbon dioxide, and water. It is important because it provides the energy required for various cellular processes.

Can you explain the difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration?
?
Aerobic respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen and produces more energy (ATP) compared to anaerobic respiration, which occurs in the absence of oxygen and produces less energy.

What are the main stages of cellular respiration?
?
The main stages of cellular respiration are Glycolysis, the Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle), and the Electron Transport Chain.

How do mitochondria adapt to different energy demands in cells?
?
Mitochondria can change in number, shape, and function depending on the energy needs of the cells, such as increasing in size and number in highly active cells.

What role do mitochondria play in apoptosis?
?
Mitochondria release cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors that activate caspases, leading to programmed cell death (apoptosis).

How does the structure of mitochondria facilitate its function?
?
The inner membrane of mitochondria is highly folded into cristae, which increase the surface area for the electron transport chain, enabling efficient ATP production.

Why is the mitochondria often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell?
?
Mitochondria are called the powerhouse of the cell because they produce ATP, the main energy supplier for cellular functions.

What is the significance of mitochondrial DNA?
?
Mitochondrial DNA is important because it is inherited maternally and encodes some of the proteins essential for mitochondrial function, contributing to energy metabolism.

Name a disease associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. What are its effects?
?
Mitochondrial myopathy is a disease associated with mitochondrial dysfunction that can lead to muscle weakness, pain, and neurological problems.
