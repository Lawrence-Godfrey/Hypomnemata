What does probability measure?
?
The likelihood of a specific event occurring within a defined set of possible outcomes.

What is the range of probability values?
?
Probability values range between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.

What does confidence refer to in the context of confidence intervals?
?
The degree of certainty that a parameter lies within a specified range.

How is a confidence level typically expressed?
?
As a percentage, such as 95%.

What does a 95% confidence interval imply about random samples?
?
If many random samples were taken, about 95% of the constructed confidence intervals would contain the true population parameter.

Does a 95% confidence interval mean there is a 95% chance that any single interval contains the parameter?
?
No, it indicates the long-term performance of the method, not the probability of a specific interval containing the parameter.

Why is confidence used in inferential statistics?
?
To express the reliability of an estimate.

What does it mean if a confidence interval does not contain the true population parameter?
?
It suggests that the method used to calculate the interval may not perform as expected in that instance, but does not invalidate the method overall.

What is an important distinction between confidence intervals and point estimates?
?
Confidence intervals provide a range of values that likely contain the parameter, while point estimates provide a single best guess for the parameter.
