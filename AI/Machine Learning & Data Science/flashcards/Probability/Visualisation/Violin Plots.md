What are violin plots used for?
?
Violin plots are used to visualize data by combining the properties of box plots and kernel density estimations, helping to understand both statistical summaries and distribution characteristics of a dataset.

How do violin plots differ from box plots?
?
Violin plots provide a visual representation of the distribution of the data across different levels or categories, in addition to summarizing statistics like median and interquartile ranges, which are also shown in box plots.

What two elements are combined in a violin plot?
?
Violin plots combine box plots and kernel density estimation (KDE) plots.

Why would you choose a violin plot over a traditional bar graph or line graph?
?
You would choose a violin plot to gain deeper insights into the distribution of the data, as they show the density estimate of the data at different values, revealing multimodality, which might not be visible in bar graphs or line graphs.

What information can you obtain from a violin plot besides the mean and median of the data?
?
A violin plot provides information about the density of data points at different values, revealing the distribution shape and possible multimodality (presence of multiple peaks).

In what scenarios are violin plots particularly useful?
?
Violin plots are particularly useful when comparing distributions between multiple groups, especially when sample sizes differ or to assess skewness and kurtosis of the data.
