What is the purpose of a QQ plot?
?
To assess if a dataset follows a particular theoretical distribution, such as the Normal Distribution.

What are the steps to create a QQ plot?
?
1. Sort your data in ascending order.
2. Standardise your data.
3. Calculate the quantiles of your data's distribution and the theoretical distribution.
4. Plot the quantiles of your data on the y-axis against the theoretical distribution on the x-axis.

What do the axes of a QQ plot represent?
?
The y-axis represents the quantiles of the data's distribution, while the x-axis represents the quantiles of the theoretical distribution.

What is the significance of the Normal Distribution in QQ plots?
?
The Normal Distribution is often used as the theoretical distribution against which the data is compared to assess normality.

What does it imply if the points on a QQ plot lie on a straight line?
?
It implies that the dataset follows the specified theoretical distribution closely.

If the points in a QQ plot deviate significantly from a straight line, what does that indicate?
?
It indicates that the dataset does not follow the specified theoretical distribution.

Why is it important to standardise data before creating a QQ plot?
?
Standardising data allows for a fair comparison between the dataset and the theoretical distribution, regardless of differences in scale.

What are quantiles in the context of a QQ plot?
?
Quantiles are values that divide a dataset into equal-sized intervals, which helps in comparing the distribution of the dataset to a theoretical distribution.
