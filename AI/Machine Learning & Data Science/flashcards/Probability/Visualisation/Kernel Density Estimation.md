What is Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)?
?
KDE is a method for estimating the Probability Density Function (PDF) of a random variable based on a finite data sample by smoothing the data with a kernel function.

What role does the kernel function play in Kernel Density Estimation?
?
The kernel function smooths the data to estimate the underlying probability distribution, providing a way to create continuous density estimates from discrete data.

Can you give an example of a kernel function used in KDE?
?
A common example of a kernel function used in KDE is the Gaussian kernel.

What is the visual difference between individual kernels and the summed kernel in KDE?
?
Individual kernels are the individual smooth curves generated at each data point, whereas the summed kernel represents the overall estimated probability density function by combining all individual kernels.

What might be a practical application of Kernel Density Estimation?
?
KDE can be used in fields such as statistics, data science, economics, and machine learning for data visualization, anomaly detection, and estimating distributions of data.

What is the purpose of using Gaussian kernels specifically in KDE?
?
Gaussian kernels are popular because they provide a smooth and continuous estimate of the PDF, and they effectively handle the data's variability.
