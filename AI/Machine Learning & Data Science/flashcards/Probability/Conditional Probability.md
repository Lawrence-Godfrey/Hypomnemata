What is conditional probability?
?
Conditional probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring, given that another event has already occurred.

How is the conditional probability of event A given event B denoted?
?
The conditional probability of event A given event B is denoted as P(A|B).

What is the formula for conditional probability P(A|B)?
?
P(A|B) = P(A∩B) / P(B), where P(A∩B) is the probability of both A and B occurring.

What is the formula for conditional probability P(B|A)?
?
P(B|A) = P(A∩B) / P(A), where P(A∩B) is the probability of both A and B occurring.

What does it mean for two events A and B to be independent?
?
If event A is independent of event B, then P(B|A) is equal to P(B).

What does P(A∩B) represent in the context of conditional probability?
?
P(A∩B) represents the probability of both events A and B occurring.

If P(B|A) is equal to P(B), what can we infer about events A and B?
?
We can infer that events A and B are independent.

Can you give an example of conditional probability in real life?
?
An example could be the probability of someone being a smoker (event A), given that they are diagnosed with lung cancer (event B).
