What is a confidence interval (CI)?
?
A range of values used to estimate a population parameter, derived from sample data, indicating where the parameter is expected to lie with a certain level of confidence.

What is a point estimate?
?
A single value estimate of a population parameter, such as a sample mean.

What does the confidence level represent?
?
The probability that the confidence interval contains the true parameter, commonly at levels of 90%, 95%, and 99%.

What is margin of error in the context of confidence intervals?
?
The range above and below the point estimate within which the true parameter is expected to lie.

Write the formula for the confidence interval when the population standard deviation is known.
?
CI = \bar{x} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.

In the confidence interval formula, what does \bar{x} stand for?
?
The sample mean.

What is the significance of Z_{\alpha/2} in the confidence interval formula?
?
It is the critical value from the standard normal distribution for the desired confidence level.

Under what assumptions can the confidence interval for the mean be calculated using the known population standard deviation?
?
1. Simple random samples are used. 2. Sample sizes > 30 or the population is approximately normal. 3. The population standard deviation is known.

What should be used instead of the z-distribution when the population standard deviation is unknown?
?
The t-distribution.

Write the formula for the confidence interval when the population standard deviation is unknown.
?
CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}.

How do you calculate the confidence interval for proportions?
?
CI = \bar{x} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}.

What does \hat{p} represent in the context of confidence intervals for proportions?
?
The proportion of samples with a certain property over the entire sample set.
