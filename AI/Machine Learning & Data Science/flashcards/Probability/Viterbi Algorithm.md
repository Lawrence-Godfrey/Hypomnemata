What is the Viterbi algorithm used for?
?
The Viterbi algorithm is used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states (the Viterbi path) that results in a sequence of observed events in the context of Hidden Markov Models.

What type of problems can the Viterbi algorithm be applied to?
?
The Viterbi algorithm can be applied to problems in speech recognition, computational biology (gene prediction), and decoding convolutional codes in wireless communication.

How does the time complexity of the Viterbi algorithm compare to brute force methods?
?
The Viterbi algorithm has a time complexity of O(L*P²), making it significantly more efficient than brute force methods which have a time complexity of O(P^L), where L is the length of the sequence and P is the number of hidden states.

What are 'hidden states' in the context of the Viterbi algorithm and HMMs?
?
Hidden states are the unobservable variables in a Hidden Markov Model that describe the system's underlying state at any given time.

Define Viterbi path.
?
The Viterbi path is the most likely sequence of hidden states determined by the Viterbi algorithm.

Why is dynamic programming important in the Viterbi algorithm?
?
Dynamic programming allows the Viterbi algorithm to efficiently compute the most likely path by breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and storing their solutions.

In a Hidden Markov Model, what does the sequence of observations correspond to?
?
The sequence of observations corresponds to the observable events that are generated by the hidden states in the model.

What is the advantage of the Viterbi algorithm over other methods when working with HMMs?
?
The Viterbi algorithm is more efficient and faster due to its polynomial time complexity (O(L*P²)), which allows it to handle larger sequences and state spaces compared to brute force methods.

Explain the significance of the terms L and P in the time complexity of the Viterbi algorithm.
?
L represents the length of the sequence of observations, and P represents the number of hidden states in the Hidden Markov Model.
