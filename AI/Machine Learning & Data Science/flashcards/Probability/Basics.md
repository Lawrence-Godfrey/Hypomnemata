What does it mean for events A and B to be disjoint?
?
Events A and B are disjoint if they cannot happen at the same time, i.e., A ∩ B = ∅.

What is the addition rule for disjoint events?
?
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) for disjoint events.

What is the addition rule for joint (not mutually exclusive) events?
?
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) for joint events.

How do you calculate the probability of the intersection of two independent events A and B?
?
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) for independent events.

What is the formula for the expected value E(X) of a discrete random variable?
?
E(X) = Σ x_i * P(x_i), where x_i represents all possible outcomes.

How is the expected value E(X) of a continuous random variable calculated?
?
E(X) = ∫ x * f(x) dx, where f(x) is the probability density function.

What is the Linearity of Expectation?
?
If X is a random variable, then E(aX + b) = aE(X) + b.

What is the Sum of Expectations property?
?
E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y), applicable regardless of the dependence of the random variables.

How is variance calculated?
?
Var(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2.

What is the relationship between standard deviation and variance?
?
Standard deviation is the square root of variance.

How do you calculate the median of a discrete data set?
?
Median(X) = (n + 1) / 2, where n is the number of observations.

When should you use the median instead of the mean?
?
Use the median when dealing with skewed distributions or outliers that could affect the mean.

Define the mode of a distribution.
?
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

How can modes be classified in a distribution?
?
Modes can be classified as unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal.

When is it appropriate to use the mode instead of the mean or median?
?
Use the mode when dealing with nominal data or when the most frequently occurring value is more significant.
