What is a Markov Chain?
?
A stochastic model that describes a sequence of possible events where the probability of an event depends only on the state of the previous event.

How can a Markov Chain be visually represented?
?
As a directed graph.

What does the transition matrix in a Markov Chain represent?
?
It represents the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another, with rows representing current states and columns representing target states.

What do the elements of the transition matrix store?
?
The probability of transitioning from the current state to the given target state.

What is the role of an initial state Ï€ in a Markov Chain?
?
It represents a starting point when there is no previous state to consider and is typically the first row of the transition matrix.

Why is a Markov Chain called 'memoryless'?
?
Because the next state only depends on the current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.

Can a Markov Chain have more than two states?
?
Yes, a Markov Chain can have multiple states (N states), represented in the transition matrix.

In a transition matrix, how are the rows and columns organized?
?
Rows represent the current state while columns represent the target state.
