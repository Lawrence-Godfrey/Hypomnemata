What is the Chain Rule in probability?
?
The Chain Rule (or General Product Rule) provides a way to calculate the joint probability of a sequence of dependent events.

How is the joint probability of events A1, A2, ..., An expressed using the Chain Rule?
?
P(A1, A2, ..., An) = P(A1) × P(A2|A1) × P(A3|A1, A2) × ... × P(An|A1, A2, ..., An-1)

What does P(A1) represent in the Chain Rule?
?
P(A1) represents the probability of event A1 occurring.

What does P(A2|A1) indicate in the context of the Chain Rule?
?
P(A2|A1) indicates the probability of event A2 occurring given that event A1 has occurred.

How do we express the joint probability of three events A1, A2, and A3?
?
P(A1, A2, A3) = P(A1) × P(A2|A1) × P(A3|A1, A2) 

What is the significance of the conditional probabilities in the Chain Rule?
?
The conditional probabilities represent how the occurrence of prior events influences the probabilities of subsequent events.

Can the Chain Rule be used for independent events?
?
Yes, for independent events, the conditional probabilities simplify, as P(A2|A1) = P(A2), making the joint probability equal to the product of the individual probabilities.

What is the general structure of the Chain Rule for n events?
?
P(A1, A2, ..., An) = P(A1) × P(A2|A1) × P(A3|A1, A2) × ... × P(An|A1, A2, ..., An-1)
