What is the purpose of sampling from a probability distribution?
?
Sampling from a probability distribution is essential for performing statistical analyses, as it allows us to generate random samples that can be used to estimate properties of the distribution.

How is a CDF created from a probability distribution?
?
A cumulative distribution function (CDF) is created by integrating the probability density function (PDF) of the distribution, giving the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.

What random value is chosen when sampling from a CDF, and what range does it fall within?
?
A random y-value is chosen between 0 and 1 when sampling from a CDF.

What does it mean if an interval has higher probability in terms of its representation on the CDF?
?
Intervals with higher probability will occupy more vertical space on the CDF, meaning that those intervals are more likely to be chosen when sampling.

Explain the process of sampling from a CDF step-by-step.
?
1. Create a CDF from the probability distribution. 2. Choose a random y-value between 0 and 1. 3. Find the corresponding x-value on the CDF for that y-value.

What is the relationship between the height of a CDF and sampling probabilities?
?
The height of a CDF at any point corresponds to the cumulative probability up to that point; intervals with greater heights (or more vertical space) indicate higher probabilities of sampling values from those intervals.
