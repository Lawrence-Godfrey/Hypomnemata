What is a random variable?
?
A random variable quantifies outcomes of a random phenomenon in terms of a numerical value.

How do you denote the outcome of 10 coin flips in a random variable?
?
You can denote it with a variable, for example, $X$, which represents the number of heads.

What is the difference between discrete and continuous random variables?
?
Discrete variables take on distinct values, while continuous variables can take on any value within a certain range.

Give an example of a continuous random variable.
?
The height of a person in the general population, which can take on any value within a certain range, say 3 feet to 7 feet.

What function is used to model discrete random variables?
?
Discrete random variables are modeled using a Probability Mass Function (PMF).

What are the requirements for a probability mass function (PMF)?
?
1. $p_{X}(x) \geq 0$; 2. $\sum_{x}p_X(x)=1$.

What is used to model continuous random variables?
?
Continuous random variables are modeled using a probability density function (PDF).

What does the y-value of a probability density function represent?
?
The y-value represents the density of the probability rather than the actual probability.

How do you obtain the actual probability from a probability density function (PDF)?
?
By integrating the PDF over a specific range.

What is one key property that must be satisfied by a probability density function (PDF)?
?
1. Must be defined for all numbers; 2. $f_{X}(x) \geq 0$; 3. $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_X(x)dx=1$.

What does it mean for the area under the curve of a PDF to equal 1?
?
It means that the total probability for all outcomes represented by the continuous random variable is equal to 1.
