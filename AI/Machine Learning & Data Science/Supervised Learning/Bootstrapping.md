Bootstrapping is a statistical resampling technique used to produce a number of representative datasets from a single dataset using sampling with replacement. It is particularly useful when the underlying distribution of the dataset is unknown, or when analytical methods of estimating distribution parameters is not possible. 

## Applications
#### Confidence Intervals
Bootstrapping can provide confidence intervals for a statistic without relying on strong parametric assumptions (e.g., normality of data).
#### Standard Error Estimation
The variability of the bootstrap samples can be used to estimate the standard error of a statistic.
#### Model Validation
In machine learning, bootstrap sampling is used in **bagging** algorithms like Random Forest to train models on different subsets of the data.
#### Hypothesis Testing
Bootstrapping allows for hypothesis testing by creating a null distribution from the resampled data.
