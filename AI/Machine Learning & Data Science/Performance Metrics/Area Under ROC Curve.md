The Area Under ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) is an important concept in Machine Learning that provides an aggregate measure of performance of a classification model across all possible classification thresholds. This is great for models which output a confidence score for predictions, as it allows us to understand the model's ability to distinguish between classes at varying thresholds.
