Relaxed Monotonicity is a property of a machine learning model where the output is *mostly* monotonic with respect to a specific input feature. This means that as a feature's value increases, the model's output will generally trend in one direction (either non-increasing or non-decreasing), but it is allowed to have some local, minor violations of this trend.

It is a less strict version of pure monotonicity, providing a balance between enforcing a general, understandable relationship and maintaining the flexibility to fit complex, real-world data that may contain noise or nuanced patterns.
