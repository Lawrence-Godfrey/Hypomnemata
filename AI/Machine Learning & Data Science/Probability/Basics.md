### Addition Rule
#### Disjoint (Mutually Exclusive) Events
•	Events A and B are disjoint if they cannot happen at the same time, i.e., A \cap B = \emptyset.
•	The addition rule for disjoint events is:
$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$
#### Joint (Not Mutually Exclusive) Events
•	Events A and B can happen at the same time.
•	The addition rule for joint events is:
$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
### Multiplication Rule
For independent events  A  and  B:
$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$
For dependent events, the [[Conditional Probability]] rule applies:
$P(A\cap B) = P(A) \times P(B | A)$
### Complementary Rule
The probability of the complement of an event  A:
$P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$
