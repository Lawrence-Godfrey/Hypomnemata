QQ plots are a tool used in statistical analysis to assess if a dataset follows a particular theoretical distribution, such as a [[Normal Distribution]]. It works by plotting the quantiles of the data set against the quantiles of a chosen theoretical distribution.

To create a QQ plot, you need to:
1. Sort your data in ascending order.
2. [[Normal Distribution#Standard Normal Distribution|Standardise your data]].
3. Calculate the quantiles of your data's distribution and the theoretical distribution.
4. Plot the quantiles of your data's distribution (on the y-axis) against the quantiles of the theoretical distribution (on the x-axis).
