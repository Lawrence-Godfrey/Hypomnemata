Kurtosis is a statistical measure that defines how heavily the tails of a distribution differ from the tails of a normal distribution.
$$
Kurtosis = E[(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma})^{4}]= \frac{E[(X - \mu)^4]}{\sigma^4}
$$
In this equation, $E[(X - μ)^4]$ is the [[Moments of a Distribution|fourth moment]] about the [[AI/Machine Learning & Data Science/Probability/Basics#Expected Value|mean]], μ is the mean, X represents each value from the dataset and σ is the standard deviation.
