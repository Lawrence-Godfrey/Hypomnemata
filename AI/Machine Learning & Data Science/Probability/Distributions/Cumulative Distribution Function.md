A Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) describes the area under the [[Random Variables|probability distribution curve]] of a random variable. It therefore provides the probability that this variable will assume a value less than or equal to a specific value. This is helpful since with a probability distribution one would have to integrate or sum over the curve to find the same probability.

$$CDF(x)=F_{X}(x) = P(X \leq x)$$
The maximum value of a CDF is always 1, but the x-value can be any real number that lies within the range of the random variable.
