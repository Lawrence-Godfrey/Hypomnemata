A t-distribution is a type of probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped, similar to the [[AI/Machine Learning & Data Science/Probability/Distributions/Normal Distribution|Normal Distribution]], but has heavier tails. It's often used in [[AI/Machine Learning & Data Science/Probability/Confidence Intervals|Confidence Intervals]] when there is uncertainty about the standard deviation in a normally distributed population, especially in small sample sizes.

## Degree of Freedom
There are actually a number of possible t-distributions based on the degree of freedom. The degree of freedom refers to the number of independent observations in a data set. As the degrees of freedom increases, the distribution approaches a Normal Distribution. This makes sense since as your sample size increases, you are more confident in your measurement, which is represented by the tails of the distribution getting smaller.
