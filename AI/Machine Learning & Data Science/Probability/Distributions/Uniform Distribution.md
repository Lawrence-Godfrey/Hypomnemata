A Uniform Distribution , also known as a rectangular distribution, is a type of [[Random Variables#Distributions|probability distribution]] in which all outcomes are equally likely.

$$
f_{X}(x)= \frac{1}{b-a}, \quad a \leq x \leq b
$$$$
f_{X}(x)= 0, \quad otherwise
$$

The above equation is the probability density function of a uniform distribution.
