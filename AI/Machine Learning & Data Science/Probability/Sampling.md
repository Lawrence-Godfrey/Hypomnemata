Sampling from a probability distribution is an important aspect of many statistical analyses. To sample from a distribution, you essentially create a CDF from the probability distribution, choose a random y-value between 0 and 1, and get the corresponding x-value.

Of course, intervals with higher probability will take up more vertical space on the CDF, and you will therefore be more likely to choose a value in that interval.
