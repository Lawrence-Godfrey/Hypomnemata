A/B testing is a method commonly used in marketing, product development, and web design to compare two versions (A and B) of a single variable to determine which one performs better. For example, it might compare two different webpage layouts to see which one results in higher conversion rates.

## Procedure
1. **Hypothesis Formulation**: Define what you want to test (e.g., a new button colour).
2. **Splitting the Sample**: Randomly divide your audience into two groupsâ€”Group A (control) and Group B (variant).
3. **Running the Test**: Expose Group A to the control version and Group B to the variant version.
4. **Data Collection**: Measure the performance of each group using predefined metrics.
5. **Analysis**: Use statistical methods to determine if there is a significant difference between the two groups.
6. **Conclusion**: Decide whether to implement the change based on the results.

## Assumptions for A/B Testing

### Random Sampling
- Each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to either the control or the variant group.
- This ensures that the groups are comparable and any differences in outcome can be attributed to the changes being tested.
### Independence
- Observations are independent of each other.
- The behaviour of one user does not influence the behaviour of another.
### Sufficient Sample Size
- The sample size must be large enough to detect a meaningful difference between the control and the variant.
- Use power analysis to determine the required sample size.
### Identical Experimental Conditions
- Apart from the element being tested, all other conditions should remain the same for both groups.
- This ensures that any observed differences can be attributed to the change being tested.
### Consistency Over Time
- The external environment should remain stable during the test period.
- Major changes in external factors (e.g., holidays, news events) can influence user behaviour and confound the results.
### No Peeking
- Avoid looking at the results before the test is complete.
- Prematurely stopping the test can lead to incorrect conclusions due to statistical noise.
### Metric Sensitivity
- The chosen metrics should be sensitive enough to detect changes caused by the variant.
- Select metrics that are directly impacted by the changes being tested.
### Homogeneous Population
- The population being tested should be homogeneous, meaning the test groups are comparable.
- Differences in user segments (e.g., demographics) should be evenly distributed between the control and variant groups.
