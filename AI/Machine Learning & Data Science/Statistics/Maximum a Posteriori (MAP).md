The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate is a method in [[AI/Machine Learning & Data Science/Probability/Bayes' Rule|Bayesian statistics]] used to estimate an unknown parameter. It is the mode of the posterior distribution, which means it is the value of the parameter that maximises the posterior probability. In simpler terms, it is the most probable value of the parameter given the observed data and prior information.

The image below shows an example of some priors (the first row) and how they are updated as data is observed. The points in the last row represent the MAP. It's interesting to note that the MAP for the column on the right is the same value as would have been obtained if you used the [[AI/Machine Learning & Data Science/Statistics/Frequentists vs Bayesians|frequentist approach instead of the Bayesian]], since the frequentist approach does not make use of any prior (or their prior is a [[AI/Machine Learning & Data Science/Probability/Distributions/Uniform Distribution|Uniform Distribution]]). In general, if your priors are not informative, then MAP will give you the same result as [[Maximum Likelihood Estimation]] (MLE).
