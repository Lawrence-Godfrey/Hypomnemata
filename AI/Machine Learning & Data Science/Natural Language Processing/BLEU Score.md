The BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) score compares candidate translations to reference (human) translations, and is commonly used in the field of natural language processing and machine translation to measure the quality of machine-generated translations. 

The BLEU score essentially calculates how many words from the candidate appear in the reference translations. This means that it does not consider semantic meaning or grammatical structure.
