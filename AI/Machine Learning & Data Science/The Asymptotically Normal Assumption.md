Many statistical models and algorithms assume that the features of a dataset are normally distributed. While [[Feature Scaling#Standardisation|standardising]] does not *make* your data normally distributed, it does transform it into a distribution that is more amenable to algorithms that make this assumption. If your data is "asymptotically normal" (it approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases), standardising it is a standard and effective preprocessing step.
